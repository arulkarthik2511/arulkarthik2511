# Project : Security Attack-Defend Simulation HomeLab

## Objective

The objective of this cybersecurity project is to demonstrate the critical importance of implementing robust cybersecurity measures, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, by showcasing the real-world risks and vulnerabilities inherent in connecting unprotected systems directly to the internet. Through the utilization of T-Pot CE (Community Edition) as a honeypot solution, the project aims to quantify and visualize the frequency, variety, and severity of cyber attacks that unsecured systems face when exposed to the internet. By providing hard statistics and practical demonstrations, the project seeks to raise awareness about cybersecurity threats and promote proactive measures to safeguard digital assets and data against malicious actors.

## Steps
-> Go to https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce/releases to download the latest iso file for the virtual machine

-> Once the basic installation is done set a strong password to the vm

-> Now we need the T pot user-id and password to login the webportal

 ->Cyberchef is a useful tool for analysing,  converting, and decoding data of different  formats, There are around 200 different  operations in CyberChef you can use from converting date and time, to decompressing 
   zipped  data or parsing an x.509 certificate.  Itâ€™s a useful tool for some of the information  youâ€™ll be collecting in your honeypots.

 ->If you want to  search for a specific bit of data, youâ€™d use elasticvue to get at the  data stored in Logstash in T-pot

 ->Spiderfoot is a footprinting and discovery tool that allows you to  run deep searches into IP addresses, websites, and domains. Its footprinting  tools allow you to learn everything you can thatâ€™s publicly 
   available about your  search query.

  ->the live map visualization  feature that shows you, in real-time, T-Pot Live attack mapall of the attacks against the 20-plus different honeypots hosted in it. Each dot that appears on the worldmap is an attacker reaching out to attack the honeypot. Down below, we have a live-updating color-coded table of the  protocols and services, the source IP addresses and countries the attacks are coming from, and  the honeypots being attacked.

  ->T-pot has some incredibly well-crafted  kibana dashboards built-in to visualize all of the different data coming into  the different honeypots
